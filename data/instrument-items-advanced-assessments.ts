/*
IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:

1. LOCKED SECTIONS:
   - Both sections are locked until all 13 dimensions are 100% complete
   - Dashboard should show these with a lock icon and "Complete all dimensions to unlock"

2. CD1A/CD1B DEPENDENCY:
   - CD1b options are dynamically filtered based on CD1a selections
   - If user selected ["Medical Leave", "Culture", "Executive Commitment"] in CD1a,
     CD1b should only show the remaining 10 dimensions

3. EI4 vs EI5 SPLIT:
   - 50% of users see EI4 (advice question)
   - 50% of users see EI5 (missing aspects + other conditions)
   - Random assignment should be stable (same user always sees same question)

4. SELECTION LIMITS:
   - CD1a: Exactly 3 selections required
   - CD1b: Exactly 3 selections required (from remaining 10)
   - CD2: Up to 3 selections

5. CONDITIONAL LOGIC:
   - EI3 only shows if EI2 = "comprehensive" or "basic" ROI analysis
   - Skip EI3 if EI2 = "currently conducting", "planning", or "no plans"

6. OTHER (SPECIFY) FIELDS:
   - CD2 has "Other (specify):" option that triggers text input
   - EI5 has "Other condition (specify):" option that triggers text input
